# GeyserExtras
# If Geyser is detected, all required config changes will be automatically applied.
# For more details, go to https://geyserextras.letsgoaway.dev/

# Enable the GeyserExtras menu, which can be opened by players by
# double-tapping inventory, or typing `/ge`.
#  
# The GeyserExtras Menu provides actions and configurable settings such as
# - Remapping certain actions (e.g emotes/pick block) to Java Edition only actions (e.g offhand)
# - Configurable HUD Visibility
# - Quick access to form remakes of Java Edition Menus
#   (e.g Player List, Advancements, Statistics).
#  
# You can configure default options for Bedrock Players at
# `preferences/default.json`
# and for Java Players at
# `preferences/java/default.json`.
#  
# Setting this to `false` also disables saving of preferences.

# Enable the Block Display entity workaround using FMBE. (EXPERIMENTAL)
# Note that the translation is not 100% accurate and some block types might be invisible (candles, doors, campfires),
# where as some blocks will render differently (fence, glass panes, some storage containers).
# Block Display billboards do not work and X/Z scale are linked to which ever one is highest,
# meaning that this should only be enabled for very simple usages of Block Displays.

# Requires PacketEvents and Java Edition clients on 1.21.9 or above.

# Enables the cape workaround. (EXPERIMENTAL)

# This shows Bedrock Edition player capes on Java Edition clients,
# by using fake mannequin player entities.
# It copies the packets of the player, so the position is identical.
# The hitbox of the mannequin is identical to the player and
# whenever the mannequin is attacked by the player it is translated as an attack
# to the bedrock player.

# This may break anti-cheats or plugins, and is not perfect.

# The Bedrock Edition player's cape will sometimes slightly clip
# inside the Bedrock Player when wearing armor and if the player attacks.

# The cape is visually removed when entering mounts that can support more than one
# player (including chest boats).

# This only works with capes that are available on Java Edition, that are also on
# Bedrock Edition.

# Whether to disable the Paper Doll or not.
# The Paper Doll is the small player graphic in the top left of bedrock players screens
# This can give players a competitive advantage over java in some cases, for example,
# you can see what armor you have on without pressing the inventory key
# you can see what armor has broken during combat

# Whether to check for updates or not.
# This also disables updating of the GeyserExtrasPack,
# however you can manually update them by deleting the 'GeyserExtras/cache/' folder.

# The priority level for the GeyserExtrasPack resource pack.
# Higher values = higher priority (packs with higher priority override files from lower-priority packs
# when file names conflict, and the client cannot easily merge them).
# Valid range: -100 to 100
# Common values:
# - -100: Lowest priority
# - 0: Normal priority
# - 100: Highest priority (default)

# Only change this if you have other resource packs that need to override GeyserExtrasPack,
# or if GeyserExtrasPack needs lower priority than your custom packs.
